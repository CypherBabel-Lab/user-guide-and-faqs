## Q1. How are the BitoBridge points calculated?

A1. points = chain\_A\_factor \* (TESTBTC\_amount \* age \* btc\_factor + TESTBITO\_amount \* age \* bito\_factor) + chain\_B\_factor \* (TESTBTC\_amount \* age \* btc\_factor + TESTBITO\_amount \* age \* bito\_factor)

**chain\_A\_factor:** The points factor for Chain A (The specific values of the current factors: Eth\_factor = 1, Arb\_factor = 3, StratoVM=3 ).

**btc\_factor:** The points factor for TESTBTC is 5,000.

**bito\_factor:** The points factor for TESTBITO is 0.01

**age:** Measured in hours.

## Q2. Does the number of transactions impact my points?

A2. A large number of transactions does not lead to more points. What affects your points is the amount bridged and the coefficient of the corresponding bridging chain.

## Q3. How can I earn more points?

A3. Since Arbitrum and StratoVM chains have higher chain\_factors, the best way to earn more points is to claim as many TestTokens as possible on time, then bridge them all at once into the Arbitrum or StratoVM chains as quickly as possible and stay on the respective chains for as long as possible.

## Q4. Why can't I generate a referral code or copy the invitation link yet?

A4. The referral points for this event haven't been activated yet. Please stay tuned.

## Q5. Why didn't the points for my transaction address increase after my transaction?

A5. The points are updated daily. So you should see your points after 24 hours.

Note: After your first bridging, your PID will be bound to the corresponding EVM address. To ensure that all your actions accumulate points to the same account, please use the wallet you used for the first connection and interact with the bound EVM address for every transaction.
