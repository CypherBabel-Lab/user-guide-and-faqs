## Q2. Why does a BTC Bridge transaction take longer to complete?

A2.

The bridge from BTC to another blockchain, e.g., Ethereum, consists of two periods:

1. Bitcoin blockchain confirmation: there is a required number of confirmations on the Bitcoin blockchain. 6 confirmations for the Livenet (\~60 mins) or 3 confirmations for the Testnet (time varies).
2. Target chain confirmation: the period varies depending on the target chain.

Please be patient. The transaction status will be updated in the 'Bridging History' table.
