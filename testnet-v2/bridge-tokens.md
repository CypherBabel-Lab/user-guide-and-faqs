# Bridge Tokens

## 1. Choose Blockchains and Token

The bridging operation interface is shown in the image. Users must select the source chain (from where), the target chain (to where), and the token they wish to bridge.

## 2. Input the Amount

Users must enter the amount of tokens they wish to bridge, as shown in the image. The amount to be received on the target chain is automatically calculated after deducting the transaction and protocol fees and is displayed in the target chain area.

## 3. Click "Bridge"

Once users have selected the source chain, target chain, and token and entered the amount, they can click the "Bridge" button to begin the bridging process. After clicking, an order confirmation window will appear, as shown in the image. Users can review the order details and click "Ok" to confirm and proceed with the bridging operation.

## 4. Claim Token for EVM chains&#x20;

If the selected target chain is an EVM-compatible blockchain, users must claim their tokens after the bridging process is completed. The "Claim" button is shown in the "Bridging history" table as in the image.
